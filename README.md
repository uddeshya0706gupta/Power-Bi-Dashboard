# Power-Bi-Dashboard
Data Visualization using Microsoft Power BI
This project demonstrates the use of Power BI to create insightful and interactive data visualizations. The dataset used in this project includes details and orders. The primary goal was to transform raw data into compelling visualizations that help stakeholders quickly identify trends, patterns, and actionable insights.

Key Features:
Data Import & Transformation: Data was imported from data  sources like Excel, CSV and transformed using Power BI's Power Query editor to clean and structure the data.
Data Modeling: Relationships between multiple data tables were defined to enable seamless integration and accurate visualizations.
Interactive Dashboards: Developed interactive dashboards with slicers, filters, and drill-throughs to allow users to explore data in-depth.
Visualizations Created: Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, KPI indicators, heat maps
Insights & Analysis: Key insights, such as specific trends, patterns, or anomalies discovered were extracted and visualized to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
